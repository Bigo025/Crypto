The Genesis Block:
The first block in the blockchain is called the genesis block and was created in 2009. 
It is the common ancestor of all the blocks in the blockchain, 
meaning that if you start at any block and follow the chain backward in time, 
you will eventually arrive at the genesis block.

Each block in the bitcoin blockchain contains a summary of all the transactions in the block, using a merkle tree.
